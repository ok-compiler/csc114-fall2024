im making a jrpg game where you attack enemies with hp and have items, powerups, etc
 
im kinda going over the top with this for the sake of learning, decided to add:

1 - progress saving (possibly, im gonna try saving in a .txt file cuz im dumb)
2 - story cuz why not
3 - different protags with different stats/traits
4 - bosses
5 - different chapters
6 - pokemon style menu for jrpg stuff, with fight/run/item options
7 - multiple files for ease of reading
8 - movement possibly, im not sure how to implement


files include:
player.h (player stats)
enemies (enemies and their stats)
items.h (items and their stats)
prog.h (progression) (idk if or how im gonna use this, just thought it'd be needed)



i would like to give proper credit to chatgpt (my best friend) for coming up with the story for this game, elsewise everything here has been written by me and me only
