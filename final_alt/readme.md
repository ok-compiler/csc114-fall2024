## this is an alternative to the final im thinking about making, it'll be way more fun and cooler i think

literally just tetris lol

# todo:

- add pieces and corresponding collision
- add piece movement/rotation
- add line clears
- add color codes for each piece
- add topout logic idk
- fix bugs and whatnot so it actually works
